# Ultimate fa fa 4+

Now that you’ve been sold on the benefits of a personal website and hopefully started building your own, you may be thinking: So, what exactly do I fill it with?
_Especially if you’re early on in your career or don’t work in a particularly visual field, it can be easy to feel like you don’t have enough content to make a personal website worth your time._
**But you’d be wrong for two reasons. First, even if you only had a page’s worth of information, putting it on a website under yourname.com is still worth it just to have some real estate on the web and make it easier for hiring managers to find you, learn about you, and get in touch with you.
Secondly, and more importantly, you have more to fill a website with than you probably realize.** To help you out, we’ve come up with a list of things that you should be including in your personal website (and, yes, a few things you should avoid at all costs).

<div className="code">

  ```javascript 
  const 4+ = jojo; 
  const 4+ = jojo; 
  const 4+ = jojo; 
  ```

</div>
